    <h2>Background: </h2>
        <h3>High technology, natural disasters, environmental extremes </h3>
        <p>With the extremes of the earth's environment and natural disasters, resulting in food shortages and hardships, as well as the high level of technological development under the cruel natural environment, people's senses have been gradually paralyzed by the extensive use of sensor, resulting in hormonal imbalance. The government medical institutions started to recruit volunteers to extract "happy, excited, nervous, soothing" hormones from their bodies and sell them in the form of "candy". You can eat the candy directly, or put it in water and drink it! </p>
        <p>With the increasing demand for hormones, the government has to make a restrictive policy on hormone using, people need to have regular health checkups and good social reputation to buy hormones, so having hormone candy has become a symbol of showing off your social status. Some businessmen seized this opportunity and produced more devices for hormone intake, including this "hormone injection ring", which has a small needle at the top, and when you press the top of the ring, the needle will pierce the "hormone candy". and mixed with anesthetic and soothing medicine into people's bodies(A removable and rotatable finger ring is built in)</p>
        <p>The first store to produce the ring was a suicide paraphernalia store, but that didn't make their business worse. A large number of customers came to the store because of the need for suicide, but the desire for happy emotions made them try to buy the more expensive hormone ring instead.</p>
        <p>Since a lot of people had become dependent on this "easy" way to get positive emotions before the government controlled hormone dosage, after the "control policy" came out, a lot of people lost their eligibility to buy hormones, so there was a lot of illegal trade, where some people buy the qualification from others at a high price, and then sell the purchased hormones at a high price.</p>
