    <h3>chapter 1: Cutting out the roots </h3>
        <h4>"Wow, it's really unlucky. I don't know how many times this month this has happened. Do you think we can still survive if we do this? I feel like my hair is falling out more and more."</h4>
        <h4>P53 glanced at P52's already thinning hair: "Stop complaining, aren't you doing this just because you are anxious for money? It's just..." He won't see Luna for a long time, P53 thought to himself, "Stop thinking too much, hurry up, hurry up ending"</h4>
        <h4>As he spoke, the two staff members wearing full radiation suits quickly dug out the last two magnetroots and quickly inserted them into their side bags.</h4>
        <h4>"P53 reports, P53 reports, D-06 area has been cleared, D-06 area has been cleared, please update the area status"</h4>
        <h4>In a dark room with full of people far away in Area A-01, employee number C31, sitting in the corner near the door, successfully received this message in his earphone: "C31 has received it, and the electromagnetic communication in the D-06 area has been restored. Normal, please bring the cleaned magnetic root grass and its roots back to area A-03 as quickly as possible. Facebook Lab has cleared the "Zhang Fei" area to accept this batch of magnetic root grass."</h4>
        <h4>"P53 has received it. All the magnetic root grass has been brought back to the Facebook laboratory by P53 drone. Please accept it."</h4>
        <h4>"Facebook "Zhang Fei Z-07" received"</h4>
        <p>"Thank you P52 and P53 for their contribution to the "Eradication" operation. Please return to the rest area safely. The jellyfish gift box is ready. Please receive the reward. Have a happy rest."</p>
        <p>"P53 received, wish turning on the lights soon"</p>
        <p>"P52 received, wish turning on the lights soon"</p>
        <p>After saying that, the indicators of P52 and P53 in front of C31 turned green, and C31 entered: 179 eradication operations were completed. Location: D06. Date: Facebook Calendar 01-078. Wish turning on the lights soon.</p>
        <p>P53 returned to the rest area of A-03-17, walked into the isolation room, sprayed disinfectant on the radiation protection suit, and cleaned the front and back. Then P53 walked into the next room, and 8 robotic arms helped him take off the protection. After taking the clothes, a robotic arm helped him put on a breathing mask, and then a huge rain head sprinkled liquid full of traditional Chinese medicine smell. After 5 minutes, P53 left the shower room and entered the next room, which was a sauna room on the left side of the room. There is a bathtub with water already in it. If you look carefully, there is some silver light in the water. There are also some beautifully packaged products delicately placed on the chair next to them, with "Jellyfish" written on them.</p>
        <p>P53 skillfully dismantled all the exquisitely arranged product packaging boxes, took out the oral liquid, bath essence and other items inside, and packed them in a radiation-proof bag with a change of clothes on the side. The clothes inside were placed aside casually. After doing all this, he slowly walked to the bathtub and sat in it. The warm water instantly enveloped his body, finally relaxing his suppressed nerves. He slowly exhaled and looked at the timer on the right. He could not leave here until he had soaked for 20 minutes. He saw When the timer started, P53 glanced at the packed jellyfish gift box and finally closed his eyes.</p>
        <p>He was really too tired, maybe because of the radiation from Magnetroot, or maybe because too many things had happened recently, which made him feel physically and mentally exhausted. Although he didn't believe that this "jellyfish" brand drug could help him reduce the damage caused by radiation. He was not a chemical genius, but he still roughly understood the principles of radiation. How could the half-life of particles appear in Magnetroot? It happened that humans broke through the research problem and shortened it successfully. But even if it couldn't change the damage caused by radiation, it was still very comfortable to soak in a hot bath. He closed his eyes and began to think about the past two months of life like a revolving door in his mind.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the world changes suddenly in an instant. Maybe you fall asleep and when you open your eyes, you no longer recognize the world in front of you. This is the world where P53 lives.</p>
