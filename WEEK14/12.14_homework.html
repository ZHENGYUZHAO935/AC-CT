     <p>A library of sounds is output via two buttons, a touch sensor, and a switch. The switch controls the size of the circle on the screen, and the two buttons and the touch sensor control three different sounds.</p>
        <p>The sound library is designed to be used by two people working together. One person controls a button and touch sensor, and the other person controls a button and knob. This sound library is more suitable as an accompaniment to the performance, and as an aid to the rhythmic drumming. </p>
